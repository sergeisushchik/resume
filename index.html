    <!--Design Philosophy-->
    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I believe that good design should be intuitive and is crucial in today’s digital- centric world. The following are principals that guide me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using frameworks, design systems, and patterns, products are designed to not only be visually enticing, but must also solve the needs of the user. Simplicity is key to achieving both needs</li>
        <li>Design in and of itself must be iterative and should aim to delight users</li>
        <li>Strategy must parallel with design to maximize usability, accomplish goals, and provide clarity for users and makers alike</li>
    </ul>
